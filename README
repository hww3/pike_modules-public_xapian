This is an interface to the Xapian text indexing library. It allows you to
create and search text indexes using boolean and probabilistic search 
queries.

Always compile this module using the c++ compiler you used to compile the 
xapian library. code calling and mangling conventions are not always
compatible between compilers (such as g++ and sunpro as a specific example).
